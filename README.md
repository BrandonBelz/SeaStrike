SeaStrike is a Battleship game that I made in my Fundamentals of Software Design course at Southern Adventist Academy while pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science. 
This project was made with the help of Parker Russo.
To play the game, Python and PySide6 must be installed on the machine. Run main.py on Python with the other two files in the same directory.
